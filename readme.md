## Data

### Abstract

The data considered in this paper is the precipitation rate in the monsoon months (June-September) over the years 2002-2012 in different locations over the latitude range 21N to 30N and the longitude range 84E to 90E. The data (TRMM~2B31, version 7) had been gathered by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and are derived by processing images recorded by the combined Precipitation Radar (PR) and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), through an algorithm (2B31). The data set consists of the latitude and the longitude of a location representing the center of a 5 km pixel, average precipitation rate over that pixel and the time of recording.
